# Demo project for Apifi library

This project showcases what a simple use case for the apifi library might look like, and includes examples and tests for most of its functionality. 

## Getting started
Take a look through the source code (i.e. data model + tests). The next step is to compile the code (`mvn compile`, etc.) and look around the *target* folder. It contains all of the code required to expose the corresponding GraphQL API. Finally, a tool such as GraphQLPLayground can be used to explore the generated API.
